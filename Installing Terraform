To use Terraform you will need to install it. HashiCorp distributes Terraform as a binary package. You can also install Terraform using popular package managers.

Homebrew on OS X:
Homebrew is a free and open-source package management system for Mac OS X. Install the official Terraform formula from the terminal.

First, install the HashiCorp tap, a repository of all our Homebrew packages

brew tap hashicorp/tap

Now, install Terraform with hashicorp/tap/terraform.

brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform

To update to the latest version of Terraform, first update Homebrew.

brew update

Then, run the upgrade command to download and use the latest Terraform version.

brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/terraform

Verify the installation: Verify that the installation worked by opening a new terminal session and listing Terraform's available subcommands

terraform -help

Add any subcommand to terraform -help to learn more about what it does and available options.

terraform -help plan

Troubleshoot: 
If you get an error that terraform could not be found, your PATH environment variable was not set up properly. Please go back and ensure that your PATH variable 
contains the directory where Terraform was installed.
