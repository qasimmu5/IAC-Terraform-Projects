In this tutorial, you will use output values to organize data to be easily queried and displayed to the Terraform user.

Output EC2 instance configurations:

Create a file called outputs.tf in your learn-terraform-aws-instance directory.
Add the configuration below to outputs.tf to define outputs for your EC2 instance's ID and IP address.

output "instance_id" {
  description = "ID of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.app_server.id
}

output "instance_public_ip" {
  description = "Public IP address of the EC2 instance"
  value       = aws_instance.app_server.public_ip
}

Inspect output values: 
You must apply this configuration before you can use these output values. Apply your configuration now. Respond to the confirmation prompt with yes

So type 
terraform apply

Terraform prints output values to the screen when you apply your configuration. Query the outputs with the terraform output command.

terraform output

You can use Terraform outputs to connect your Terraform projects with other parts of your infrastructure, or with other Terraform projects. 

Destroy Infrastructure: 
terraform destroy
