Once you no longer need infrastructure, you may want to destroy it to reduce your security exposure and costs. For example, you may remove a production environment 
from service, or manage short-lived environments like build or testing systems. In addition to building and modifying infrastructure, Terraform can destroy or 
recreate the infrastructure it manages.

Destroy:
The terraform destroy command terminates resources managed by your Terraform project. This command is the inverse of terraform apply in that it terminates all 
the resources specified in your Terraform state. It does not destroy resources running elsewhere that are not managed by the current Terraform project.

Destroy the resources you created.

terraform destroy

The - prefix indicates that the instance will be destroyed. As with apply, Terraform shows its execution plan and waits for approval before making any changes.

Answer yes to execute this plan and destroy the infrastructure.
