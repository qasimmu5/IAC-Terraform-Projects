In production environments you should keep your state secure and encrypted, where your teammates can access it to collaborate on infrastructure. The best way to 
do this is by running Terraform in a remote environment with shared access to state.

Terraform Cloud allows teams to easily version, audit, and collaborate on infrastructure changes. It also securely stores variables, including API tokens and 
access keys, and provides a safe, stable environment for long-running Terraform processes

Set Up Terraform Cloud:
If you do not have a Terraform Cloud account, please sign up for free here and create an organization. Make a note of the organization's name. Organizations are 
privately shared spaces for teams to collaborate on infrastructure
